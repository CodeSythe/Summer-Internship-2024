# Intro
We were working with Vertex 80v FTIR made by Bruker.
The system works with OPUS software from bruker.

## Funtions
The code contains two funtions
- file_prop - returns the spectra file properties.
- plot_spec - plots data from the spectra file, extra utility can convert wavenumber to wavelength and multiply the whole spectra sile so that its easier to compare.
